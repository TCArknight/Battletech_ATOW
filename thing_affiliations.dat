<!-- This file contains the assortment of affiliations for the game system. The special
      advantages of each affiliation are conferred through a combination of scripts and
      automatic assignment of attribute adjustments, skills, and character traits. All 
	  changes are assigned via the bootstrapping of the item, resulting in the item being
      automatically assigned to the actor whenever the affiliation is selected. If something
      is both user-selected AND conferred by an affiliation, the ability only appears a single
      time because it all abilities are "unique".

    description="Having suffered badly at the hands of its neighbors for centuries, the Capellan Confederation has become a virtual police state, its people wary of enemies within and without and devoted to survival at any cost. Nearly destroyed by the Steiner-Davion offensive in the Fourth Succession War, the determined Capellan people rallied with fanatical zeal that reached its apex with the ascent of Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao, whose Xin Sheng (Rebirth) movement revitalized the nation and marked a resurgence of the ancient Chinese culture that now dominates the realm.">
